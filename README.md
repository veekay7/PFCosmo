# La Petite Fee Cosmo - 小さな妖精コスモ

La Petite Fee Cosmo is a fantasy-themed, educational puzzle game aimed at helping computer science students understand the programming concept of Linked Lists. I developed the game for Nanyang Technological University's School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE). The game was developed as part of the Productive Failure project.

The game was developed to help students who are new to computer science subjects better understand data structures. Specifically, the students had trouble understanding the concept of linked lists. The game's level design is inspired by the past-year data structures test questions, and this helps students better visualise how linked lists works.

The game is now deployed at Nanyang Technological University's SCSE computer science courses to help students who are struggling with data structure concepts. The game has been well received by students and students who were struggling have shown visible improvements in their results. Two papers for the game have been published at Cyberworlds 2019 Kyoto:

- 2019, V.T. Kannappan et al. “La Petite Fee Cosmo: Learning Data Structures Through Game-based Learning”, International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW), Kyoto, Japan.
- 2019, H.E. Lye, J.Y.J. Hong and V.T. Kannappan, “The Art of La Petite Fee Cosmo”, International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW), Kyoto, Japan.

## Synopsis
### Story
In a land far far away, up in the clear skies over the Highlands of Skye, there is a floating island where fairies live in peace and harmony. One day, a small, cheerful but mischievous fairy, Cosmo, climbed a sacred altar in the palace of the fairies and caused a magical accident, placing her in an alternative version of her world where her world is in ruins. Cosmo was scared and wishes to return home. Can you help Cosmo return back to her original world?

### Cosmo

The only daughter of the ruler of fairies. She is a jovial but mischievous fairy and is always being reprimanded by her father. However, she is smart and good with magic which has helped her in many sticky situations.

## Gameplay


- Help Cosmo return to her original world by collecting Power Stones from various locations in the dilapidated version of her world. Power Stones appear when a challenge is complete. Help Cosmo build a bridge and help her collect these Power Stones.

- The puzzle element of the game is based on the Linked List programming concept.

- The bridge Cosmo needs to build is build of a series of terrain pieces. Each piece contains a number. The pieces must be arranged in the right order for the bridge to fully take shape. Getting the right results will make Cosmo gleefully cross the bridge and reach to the other side.

- Each puzzle has a limited number of moves that Cosmo can use to solve. This makes each level challenging and each person can utilise these moves in different ways to solve the levels quickly.
