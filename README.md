# La Petite Fee Cosmo - 小さな妖精コスモ

La Petite Fee Cosmo is an educational puzzle game I developed for Nanyang Technological University's School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE). The game was developed as part of the Productive Failure project.

The game was developed to help students who are new to computer science subjects better understand data structures. Specifically, the students had trouble understanding the concept of linked lists. The game's level design is inspired by the past-year data structures test questions, and this helps students better visualise how linked lists works.
